== [[ContextCleaner]] ContextCleaner

It does cleanup of shuffles, RDDs and broadcasts.

CAUTION: FIXME What does the above sentence *really* mean?

It uses a daemon *Spark Context Cleaner* thread that cleans RDD, shuffle, and broadcast states (using `keepCleaning` method).

CAUTION: FIXME Review `keepCleaning`

link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#[ShuffleDependencies] register themselves for cleanup using `ContextCleaner.registerShuffleForCleanup` method.

ContextCleaner uses a link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext].

|======================
| Spark Property | Default Value | Description

| [[spark_cleaner_referenceTracking]] `spark.cleaner.referenceTracking`
| `true`
| Controls whether a `ContextCleaner` should be created when a link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-instance[`SparkContext` initializes].

| [[spark_cleaner_referenceTracking_blocking]] `spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.blocking`
| `true`
| Controls whether the cleaning thread should block on cleanup tasks (other than shuffle, which is controlled by <<spark_cleaner_referenceTracking_blocking_shuffle, spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.blocking.shuffle>> Spark property).

It is `true` as a workaround to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3015[SPARK-3015 Removing broadcast in quick successions causes Akka timeout].

| [[spark_cleaner_referenceTracking_blocking_shuffle]] `spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.blocking.shuffle`
| `false`
| Controls whether the cleaning thread should block on shuffle cleanup tasks.

It is `false` as a workaround to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3139[SPARK-3139 Akka timeouts from ContextCleaner when cleaning shuffles].

| [[spark_cleaner_referenceTracking_cleanCheckpoints]] `spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints`
| `false`
| Controls whether to clean checkpoint files if the reference is out of scope.
